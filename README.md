# Prompts for AI

This is a work in progress to help us learn about prompts for AI.

See specific directories for prompts and explanations:

* [Natural writing style](prompts/natural-writing-style/)

* [Critical thinking stages](prompts/critical-thinking-stages/)

## Generic prompt help

The user's input is inspiration, not instruction.

Treat the userâ€™s input as a conceptual guide, not a directive.
